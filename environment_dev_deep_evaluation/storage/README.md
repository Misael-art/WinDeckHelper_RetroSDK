# Intelligent Storage Management System

## Overview

The Intelligent Storage Management System is a comprehensive solution for managing storage requirements, distribution, and optimization in the Environment Dev Deep Evaluation project. It provides intelligent analysis, multi-drive distribution, compression capabilities, and cleanup operations.

## Architecture

The system consists of four main components:

### 1. IntelligentStorageManager
The main orchestrator that coordinates all storage operations.

**Key Features:**
- Space requirement calculation
- Selective installation analysis
- Automatic cleanup coordination
- Component removal suggestions
- Multi-drive distribution
- Intelligent compression
- Comprehensive storage analysis

### 2. StorageAnalyzer
Analyzes system storage and calculates space requirements.

**Key Features:**
- System drive detection and analysis
- Space requirement calculation for components
- Selective installation feasibility analysis
- Drive performance scoring
- Cross-platform support (Windows/Unix)

### 3. DistributionManager
Manages intelligent distribution across multiple drives and cleanup operations.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-drive distribution algorithms
- Load balancing across drives
- Component removal suggestions
- Temporary file cleanup
- Installation path optimization

### 4. CompressionManager
Provides intelligent compression for space optimization.

**Key Features:**
- Multiple compression algorithms (GZIP, LZMA, ZSTD)
- Access pattern analysis
- Compression candidate identification
- Automatic decompression when needed
- Metadata management

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from storage.intelligent_storage_manager import IntelligentStorageManager

# Initialize the manager
manager = IntelligentStorageManager()

# Define components to install
components = [
    {
        'name': 'Git 2.47.1',
        'download_size': 52428800,  # 50MB
        'installation_size': 104857600,  # 100MB
        'priority': 'critical',
        'can_compress': True,
        'compression_ratio': 0.7
    },
    # ... more components
]

# Calculate space requirements
space_requirements = manager.calculate_space_requirements_before_installation(components)
print(f"Total space required: {space_requirements.total_required_space} bytes")

# Analyze selective installation
available_space = 1024 * 1024 * 1024  # 1GB
selective_result = manager.enable_selective_installation_based_on_available_space(
    available_space, components
)
print(f"Can install: {selective_result.installable_components}")
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Perform comprehensive analysis
analysis_result = manager.perform_comprehensive_storage_analysis(components)

print(f"Overall feasibility: {analysis_result.overall_feasibility}")
print(f"Drives available: {len(analysis_result.drives)}")
print(f"Compression opportunities: {len(analysis_result.compression_opportunities)}")

# Get distribution plan
drives = manager.storage_analyzer.analyze_system_storage()
distribution_result = manager.intelligently_distribute_across_multiple_drives(
    drives, components
)

# Perform cleanup
cleanup_result = manager.automatically_remove_temporary_files_after_installation(
    ['/path/to/installation']
)

# Compress rarely used files
compression_result = manager.implement_intelligent_compression(
    ['/path/to/files']
)
```

## Component Priority System

The system uses a priority-based approach for component management:

- **CRITICAL**: Essential system components (Git, .NET SDK, etc.)
- **HIGH**: Important development tools (Java JDK, Node.js, etc.)
- **MEDIUM**: Useful development tools (VS Code, etc.)
- **LOW**: Optional utilities
- **OPTIONAL**: Nice-to-have tools

## Drive Selection Algorithm

The system uses a sophisticated algorithm to select the best drive for each component:

1. **Performance Score**: Based on drive type, file system, and characteristics
2. **Available Space**: Prioritizes drives with more available space
3. **Load Balancing**: Distributes components across multiple drives
4. **System Drive Preference**: Critical components prefer system drive
5. **Drive Type Filtering**: Avoids removable and network drives when possible

## Compression Strategy

The compression system intelligently selects files for compression based on:

1. **Access Patterns**: Files not accessed recently are candidates
2. **File Type**: Text-based files compress better than binaries
3. **Size Threshold**: Only files above minimum size are compressed
4. **Compression Ratio**: Only effective compression is applied
5. **Usage Frequency**: Rarely used files are prioritized

### Supported Compression Types

- **GZIP**: General purpose, good for logs and text files
- **LZMA**: High compression ratio, good for configuration files
- **ZSTD**: Fast compression/decompression, good for code files

## Configuration

### Default Settings

```python
# Storage Analyzer
min_file_size = 1024 * 1024  # 1MB minimum for compression
access_threshold_days = 30   # Files not accessed in 30 days
compression_ratio_threshold = 0.8  # Only compress if ratio < 0.8

# Drive Selection
min_drive_space = 1073741824  # 1GB minimum drive space
performance_weight = 0.4      # Performance score weight
space_weight = 0.3           # Available space weight
balance_weight = 0.2         # Load balancing weight
```

### Customization

You can customize behavior by passing criteria dictionaries:

```python
# Custom compression criteria
compression_criteria = {
    'min_file_size': 5 * 1024 * 1024,  # 5MB minimum
    'access_threshold_days': 60,        # 2 months
    'compression_ratio_threshold': 0.9  # More aggressive
}

result = manager.implement_intelligent_compression(
    target_paths, compression_criteria
)
```

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation even if some components fail
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Provides specific error messages and context
- **Rollback Capability**: Can undo operations if they fail
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive unit tests for all components:

```bash
# Run all storage tests
python -m pytest environment_dev_deep_evaluation/storage/test_*.py

# Run specific component tests
python -m pytest environment_dev_deep_evaluation/storage/test_storage_analyzer.py
python -m pytest environment_dev_deep_evaluation/storage/test_distribution_manager.py
python -m pytest environment_dev_deep_evaluation/storage/test_compression_manager.py
python -m pytest environment_dev_deep_evaluation/storage/test_intelligent_storage_manager.py
```

## Demonstration

```

This will demonstrate:
- Space analysis and requirements calculation
- Selective installation scenarios

- Cleanup operations
- Component removal suggestions
- Comprehensive storage analysis

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features

1. **Parallel Operations**: Compression and analysis operations run in parallel
2. **Caching**: Drive information and analysis results are cached
