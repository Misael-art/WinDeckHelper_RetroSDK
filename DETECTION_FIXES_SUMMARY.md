# Summary of Detection System Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address the issues in the detection system.

## 1. Fixed Retro Devkits False Positive Detection

### Issue
The system was detecting retro devkits components as installed even when they weren't present due to incorrect path resolution.

### Solution
Modified `core/yaml_component_detection.py` to:
1. Add `_resolve_path` method to correctly resolve relative paths
2. Add `_is_project_component` method to identify and exclude project components
3. Update `_detect_yaml_component` to skip project components

### Changes Made
- Added path resolution logic to check common installation directories first
- Added logic to identify project components by checking if paths are within the project directory
- Modified detection to skip project components

## 2. Prevented Unwanted VSCode Instances from Opening

### Issue
Multiple VSCode instances were being opened when clicking "Verificar Instalados" because the executable validation was triggering the application instead of just checking its version.

### Solution
Modified `core/detection_engine.py` to:
1. Add flags to prevent GUI applications from opening during version checks
2. Update subprocess calls to run in a hidden window

### Changes Made
- Updated `_validate_executable_functionality` method in `CustomApplicationDetectionStrategy` to use `--disable-extensions` and `--disable-gpu` flags for VSCode
- Added `creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW` to all subprocess calls
- Added `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL`, `stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL`, `stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL` to prevent output

## 3. Improved Detection Deduplication for Python Entries

### Issue
Multiple Python entries appeared in detection results due to multiple detection strategies running simultaneously without proper deduplication.

### Solution
Enhanced `_merge_detections` method in `DetectionEngine` to:
1. Group Python-related detections separately
2. Apply smarter deduplication based on confidence and detection method priority
3. Log filtered detections for debugging

### Changes Made
- Added special handling for Python detections in `_merge_detections`
- Implemented sorting by confidence, detection method priority, and version
- Added logging for filtered Python detections

## 4. Distinguished Project Components from User Installations

### Issue
Components like Dotnet Desktop, Dotnet Sdk, Java Jdk, and Nodejs were showing project paths instead of real installations.

### Solution
Added project component filtering in `DetectionEngine`:
1. Added `_is_project_component` method to identify project components
2. Updated `_validate_detected_applications` to filter out project components

### Changes Made
- Added `_is_project_component` method to check if install or executable paths are within the project directory
- Modified `_validate_detected_applications` to filter out project components before validation

## Testing

The fixes have been implemented and address all the reported issues:

1. ✅ Retro devkits false positive detection fixed
2. ✅ Unwanted VSCode instances prevented
3. ✅ Python detection deduplication improved
4. ✅ Project components distinguished from user installations

## Files Modified

- `core/yaml_component_detection.py`
- `core/detection_engine.py`

These changes should resolve all the erratic behavior reported in the detection system.
