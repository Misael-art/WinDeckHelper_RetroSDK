  - Toast notifications with different severity levels (Info, Success, Warning, Error, Progress)
  - Progress tracking for long-running operations
  - Non-intrusive notification display with auto-dismiss
  - Notification history and advanced log viewer

- **Created `env_dev/gui/enhanced_dashboard.py`**: Integrated dashboard with real-time feedback:
  - Real-time progress dialogs with detailed feedback
  - Component installation dialog with progress tracking
  - Integration with notification system for seamless user experience
  - Background task monitoring and status updates

**Key Features**:
- **NotificationCenter**: Central management of all notifications with categorization
- **Toast Notifications**: Modern, non-intrusive notifications with animations
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed progress monitoring for operations with step-by-step feedback
- **Real-time Updates**: Live status updates without blocking the user interface
- **Log Viewer**: Advanced log viewing with search, filtering, and export capabilities

## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
```
env_dev/gui/
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard_gui.py          # Base dashboard components
â”œâ”€â”€ notification_system.py    # Real-time notification system
â”œâ”€â”€ enhanced_dashboard.py     # Integrated dashboard with feedback
â”œâ”€â”€ app_gui.py               # Original Tkinter interface (fallback)
â””â”€â”€ app_gui_qt.py            # PyQt5 interface (fallback)
```

### Integration Points
- **Manager Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with all existing managers:
  - DiagnosticManager for system health checks
  - InstallationManager for component installation
  - DownloadManager for file downloads
  - OrganizationManager for system cleanup
  - RecoveryManager for system recovery

- **Fallback System**: Implements a robust fallback system:
  1. Enhanced Dashboard (Primary)
  2. PyQt5 Interface (Secondary)
  3. Original Tkinter Interface (Final fallback)

### Key Classes and Components

#### NotificationSystem
- **NotificationCenter**: Central notification management
- **NotificationToast**: Modern toast notification widgets
- **ProgressTracker**: Detailed progress tracking for operations
- **LogViewer**: Advanced log viewing and management

#### Dashboard Components
- **StatusCard**: Reusable status display widgets
- **EnhancedDashboard**: Main dashboard with integrated feedback
- **RealTimeProgressDialog**: Detailed progress dialogs
- **ComponentInstallDialog**: Enhanced installation interface

## User Experience Improvements

### Before (Original Interface)
- Basic Tkinter interface with limited feedback
- No real-time progress tracking
- Minimal error reporting
- Static component list without status information

### After (Enhanced Interface)
- Modern, intuitive dashboard with clear system status
- Real-time progress tracking with detailed feedback
- Non-intrusive notifications with categorization
- Dynamic component management with status indicators
- Comprehensive error reporting with suggested solutions
- Advanced log viewing and search capabilities

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage
Created comprehensive test suite (`test_enhanced_gui.py`) covering:
- **Integration Test**: Component import and basic functionality
- **Notification System Test**: Toast notifications and progress tracking
- **Dashboard Components Test**: Status cards and UI components
- **Progress Dialog Test**: Real-time progress feedback
- **Enhanced Dashboard Test**: Full dashboard functionality

### Test Results
```
âœ“ Integration Test: PASS
âœ“ Notification System: PASS
âœ“ Dashboard Components: PASS
âœ“ Progress Dialog: PASS
âœ“ Enhanced Dashboard: PASS

Total: 5/5 tests passed
ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed! The Enhanced GUI is working correctly.
```
